How to Play Snake
There are only two rules you must follow when playing: don’t hit a wall and don’t bite your own tail. Crashing into a wall or your tail will end the game immediately. Your high score is calculated based on the number of squares you added to the snake. You win the game when there is no more room for your snake to grow. 

Move Fast, Think Fast! 
Not only does your snake grow longer each time it eats, it moves faster than the traditional game as well. 

In order to master the Coolmath Games Snake, your reaction time will be tested. This snake moves quickly, so you’ll have to master reacting fast in order to turn away before you collide with the walls or tail. Those sharp turns can only be mastered by practice, so get going! 

To easily control the snake as it grows longer and longer, try sticking close by the wall. There are only four turns you have to make if you ride the sides of the screen. If your snake grows long enough, you can zig-zag around the screen as well.
you can control your moving by your key arowes in your keybord
